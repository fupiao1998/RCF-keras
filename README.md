# RCF-keras
A keras implementation of RCF(Richer Convolutional Features for Edge Detection) for image edge detection.
Created by Yuxin Mao, if you have any problem in using it, please contact: maoyuixnssyh@my.swjtu.deu.cn
The backbone of this task now is VGG16, I will make a ResNet-based version in the future.
